This small Python project demonstrates my understanding of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques. 
The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting letters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique using Python. 
The Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

In this program, a function named caesar_shift is defined with two parameters â€” message and shift. 
The function works by iterating through each character of the input message, converting alphabetic characters to their corresponding Unicode values using the ord() function, 
applying the shift, and then converting them back to characters using chr(). 
The result is a new string where each letter has been replaced by another.
Then decryption can be done by giving the input with subtract symbol.
